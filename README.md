# Data in the Bachelor Universe
Author: Alaina Holland
## Note:
This read-me will be updated periodically as I go through each stage of the Data Science Process. Stay tuned!


## Objective
To showcase my understanding of various aspects of data science as encapsulated in my Masters of Data Science. This includes statistical analysis in R, data visualization, data engineering, data ethics, survival analysis, and machine learning.


## Methodology

### Data Collection - CURRENT STAGE
- Describe the sources of your data (e.g., Wikipedia, official Bachelor websites).
- Explain the process and tools used for data scraping and collection.

### Data Cleaning
- Detail the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data.
- Mention how missing values, data types, and inconsistencies were handled.

## Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis using R
- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
- Include visualizations and summary statistics.

#### Trend Findings
- Discuss the trends identified during EDA.
- Include relevant plots and charts.

### Survival Analysis
- Conduct survival analysis to study the duration of contestants' participation.
- Determine if there are other trends (i.e. Race, Occupation, Geographic Location) that impact survival probability
- Use Kaplan-Meier estimators or other techniques.

#### Findings
- Summarize the results of the survival analysis.
- Include survival curves and interpretations.

### Machine Learning
- Build predictive models to forecast outcomes such as contestant success.
- Detail the features used, model selection, and evaluation metrics.

#### Findings
- Summarize the performance and insights from the machine learning models.
- Include feature importance and other relevant metrics.

## Conclusion
- Summarize the key findings and insights from the project.
- Discuss the implications and potential future work.
